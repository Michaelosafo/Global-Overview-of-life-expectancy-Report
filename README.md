Despite significant global progress in healthcare, life expectancy rates remain disparate across continents, with some regions experiencing stagnant or declining trends. Understanding the complex relationships between economic factors, mortality rates, and life expectancy is crucial for developing targeted interventions to address these disparities.


## Research Findings

This study reveals:


1. Continental Disparities: A strong positive correlation exists between GDP and life expectancy across continents, with North America and Europe exhibiting the highest life expectancy rates.


1. Mortality Factors: Adult mortality rates significantly impact life expectancy, with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis being leading contributors to mortality in developing regions.


1. Key Predictors: GDP, adult mortality rates, and access to healthcare services are the most influential predictors of life expectancy.


1. Continental Priorities: The top 5 continents requiring urgent attention due to low life expectancy rates are:
    - Africa
    - Southeast Asia
    - Eastern Mediterranean
    - South America
    - Western Pacific
